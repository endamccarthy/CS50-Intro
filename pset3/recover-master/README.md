# recover
Harvard CS50 pset3

This is a program designed to recover deleted JPEG images from a sourcefile such as a memory card in a digital camera. 
The file must be saved to the same directory as the program. The user types the name of the file (including .jpg) 
in the command line. If the program runs correctly, any recovered images will be saved to the same directory.
