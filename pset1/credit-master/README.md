# credit
Harvard CS50 pset1

This is a program designed to check if a credit card number is valid. It will also state the type of credit card if it is valid. If the number entered does not contain the correct number of digits or the correct numbers at the start for the different types it will output as INVALID. If the number does not meet the rules set out by Luhn's Algorithm (a common check for credit card number validity) then it will also output INVALID. If the number is valid then it will only output the card type.
