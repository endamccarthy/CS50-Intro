                Electrical Engineer, Arup Dubai (Oct 2017 – Dec 2018)
            </h5>
            <p>
                Much of my time in Dubai was spent in the role of project engineer on site in Abu Dhabi.
                I also worked on various other projects ranging from detailed designs to peer reviews.<br/>
                <br/>
                Some of my duties included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resolving various design issues on site and carrying out daily site inspections.</li>
                <li>Responding to contractor submittals, i.e. RFI's, material approvals, shop drawings, etc.</li>
                <li>Attending progress meetings involving the client, contractor and project management.</li>
                <li>Developing detailed electrical designs using the Revit software program (4D building information modelling software).</li>
                <li>Preparing reports and presentations.</li>
                <li>Carrying out peer reviews of electrical systems on final detailed designs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>
                Sample Project Experience:
            </h6>
            <h6>
                Qasr Al Hosn, Abu Dhabi, UAE
            </h6>
            <p>
                This project involved the extensive restoration of the historic fort buildings on the landmark
                Qasr al-Hosn site. My role was mostly based on site implementing the electrical design.
                There was numerous elements which at times made the project quite difficult to manage, for instance
                there was constantly new archaeological discoveries resulting in last minute design changes on site.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Dubai Airports, Dubai, UAE
            </h6>
            <p>
                This consisted of developing the 100% detailed electrical design for the refurbishment of a number
                of concourse areas in Dubai airport. The design was co-ordinated in Revit, working from point cloud
                scans taken from the existing space in the airport.
                I also investigated the possibility of providing a large, futuristic media ceiling over a concourse area.
                This involved preparing detailed reports and meeting with various suppliers to determine a suitable strategy.

                Electrical Design Engineer, Arup Cork (Aug 2014 – Oct 2017)
            </h5>
            <p>
                The majority of these 3 years was spent working on the detailed electrical design of several metro stations
                located in the Middle East. I also worked on various other detailed design projects including a confidential
                hospital project. I gained an in-depth knowledge of the use of Revit throughout this time. I also became familiar
                with a visual programming software called Dynamo BIM, this software enabled us to access the Revit API and
                create scripts (using Python) to automate any number of processes in Revit.<br/>
                <br/>
                My duties throughout the 3 years in Cork included developing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire alarm designs including loop schedules and schematics.</li>
                <li>Small power designs including Amtech calculations.</li>
                <li>Normal and emergency lighting designs including DIALux calculations.</li>
                <li>Electrical schematics and maximum demand calculations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>
                Sample Project Experience:
            </h6>
            <h6>
                Confidential Healthcare Client, Ireland
            </h6>
            <p>
                I performed the role of project engineer on the detailed electrical design of a pathology laboratory for
                a new healthcare building in Dublin. The design was fully coordinated in Revit and Navisworks.
                The role I played in this project included overseeing the work of less experienced engineers, providing
                guidance, instruction and reviewing work where needed. The areas of design included in the scope
                consistedof small power, lighting, fire alarm, security and data.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Confidential Metro Project, Middle East
            </h6>
            <p>
                I was part of a designated MEP team in the Cork office responsible for the design of a large underground
                metro station in the Middle East. The design was fully co-ordinated in Revit between MEP, structures and
                architecture. As part of this project I spent over 3 months in the Singapore office towards the end of
                2016, this time was spent developing the fire alarm design of 2 stations for 100% detailed design issue.
                I also assisted several other overseas offices with their station designs, this included providing step
                by step guidelines for the design of both the back of house and front of house lighting using Revit.

                Apprentice Electrician, ESB Networks, Ireland (Sep 2009 – Sep 2011)
            </h5>
            <p>
                I joined ESB Networks in 2009 as an apprentice electrician after finishing secondary school. There was a
                programme in place at the time which would see a select few apprentices receive scholarships to pursue an
                engineering degree at some point during their apprenticeship. I successfully obtained an ESB scholarship
                and was enrolled in 2nd year of electrical engineering in Cork IT in September 2011.
                Some of my duties included the construction and maintenance of HV, MV and LV networks (both overhead and
                underground), panel wiring in sub-stations, new customer connections, urban network renewal and storm damage repair.
