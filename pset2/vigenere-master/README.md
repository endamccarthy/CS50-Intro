# vigenere
Harvard CS50 pset2

This program is similar to the caesar program. The difference being that instead of taking a numeric 
value as the key and using this same value for each character of the 'plaintext' message; vigenere 
takes an alphabetic keyword, converts each letter to a numeric equivalent and then applies the key 
to the message as follows: Key = abc, message = Hello, H is rotated 'a' times, e 'b' times, l 'c' times, 
l 'a' times and o 'b' times.
