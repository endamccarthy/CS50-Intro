This is an encryption program. The user inputs a numeric key in the command line after the filename and a space.
The user is then prompted to enter a 'plaintext' message. This message is encrypted by rotating each letter by 'key' amounts.
The case of each letter is maintained. If the character in the message is not an alphabetic letter it is not changed.
The encrypted message is then printed as 'ciphertext'.
